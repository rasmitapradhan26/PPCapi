# xlsx-mysql

> compares a xlsx worbook to a mysql database and applies the changes found in workbook

## PLEASE HELP

Since this is my first NPM module and I am only barely familiar with node, this program only barely works. The following things need to be addressed:
* The function does not return anything, I have tried to make it return something but I was unable to.
* For now it uses a sleepfunction in the for loop per number of sheets. This is not the best way, and I am sure there is some kind of alternative to fix this.

IF ANYONE OF YOU COULD HELP FIX THIS, THEN PLEASE DO BY ALL MEANS AND OPEN A PULL REQUEST

## DESCRIPTION
This project uses two other node modules to upload a xlsx workbook into a mysql database.
The following things need to be kept in mind when using:
* The name of the sheets must be table names in your MYSQL DB.
* Column names should match exactly.
* A delimiter needs to be used.
* If only the last sheet's data is being processed then take a look at the waitT variable and add extra time to allow for the sheet to be processed.

        database: 'test',
        password: 'password',
